## Inspiration
asfjkhasujklasf
English is not everyone's first language and the one who teaches us a language that is so versatile across the globe is our Teacher.  With respect towards a language and our teachers, we have developed Vocabot.

## What it does
Vocabot brings vocabulary learning in a fun and simple way. The Administrator of the channel can upload a .txt file of words to be learned by students. Students can react to the message to get the vocab role which will allow them to see the Vocab-track channel. Using commands like `.daily` and `.test` the bot will send 5 Daily words of learning with definitions and examples and a test word in Personal chat wherein students can type in the word in sentence form which will be checked for relevancy using Semantic Similarity in Natural Language Processing. 

## How we built it
The bot is entirely made using Python and Discord API commands with MongoDB as our go-to database for scaling solutions. Additionally, NLP algorithms are used for Semantic Similarity and to gauge the level of user input examples. Word meanings and examples are fetched from FreedictionaryAPI.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating the bot with functions capable to read the attachments was a hassle with that data being uploaded to the database for every individual server instance. Creating additional test functionality using NLP was 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Adding the last-moment functionality of testing procedures was a feat we are proud of, bringing in NLP functionality for testing procedures using semantic similarity algorithms was the moment of achievement for us.

## What we learned
Learning is an ongoing process and our team realizes it. To bring scalable learning with fun is what we aimed for. While developing this bot there were many instances to drop the idea with series of failures but we were adamant to bring Teachers and students likewise a fun and short way to learn. 

## What's next for VocaBot
We want to bring scalable learning to everyone hence we choose MongoDB as our preferred solution. Those wanting to learn and adapt or to enrich their vocabulary can definitely try VocaBot. Those teachers wanting to bring a twist in learning with Discord can eventually use it.
